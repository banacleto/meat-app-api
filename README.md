# Meat Angular Api - REST API/GraphQL With Node.js, MongoDB, Fastify and Swagger

## 1. Letâ€™s Get Started

### The technology we use:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Fastify (CORS, Blipp)
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- Swagger
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

Initialize a new project by opening your terminal and executing the following lines of code:

```
mkdir fastify-api
cd fastify-api
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.js
npm init
```

### Install all the dependencies that we will need

`npm i nodemon mongoose fastify fastify-cors fastify-blipp fastify-swagger fastify-gql graphql boom`

### Below is a brief description of what each package does, quoted from their respective websites:

**nodemon** is a tool that helps develop Node.js-based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node, to use nodemon replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.

To set up nodemon, we need to add the following line of code to our package.json file, in the scripts object:

`"start": "nodemon src/index.js"`

**mongoose** provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

**fastify** is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and, as far as we know, it is one of the fastest web frameworks in town.

**fastify-cors** enables the use of CORS in a Fastify application.

**fastify-blipp** prints your routes to the console. So each time your server starts, you know which endpoints are available.

**fastify-swagger** is a swagger documentation generator for fastify. It uses the schemas you declare in your routes to generate a swagger compliant doc.

**fastify-gql** fastify barebone GraphQL adapter.

**graphql** the javascript reference implementation for GraphQL.

**boom** provides a set of utilities for returning HTTP errors.

## 2. Running

Once MongoDB has been successfully installed, you can open a new terminal window and start up a MongoDB instance by running the following:

`mongod`

With MongoDB, we do not need to create a database. We can just specify a name in the setup and, as soon as we store data, MongoDB will create this database for us. You can now run the following code in your src directory in your terminal:

`npm start`
